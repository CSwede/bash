# Right click inside terminal to find preferences (change cursors to I-beam)

# pwd = "print working directory"

# grep <SearchWord> <filename>
  # Will search through the file <filename> for the word <SearchWord>. And everytime it finds the <SearchWord> it will display
  that line in the terminal.

# diff <file1> <file2> will show you the difference between the two files.
  # Will print out the lines that are different between the two files.
  
# passwd to change your password

# ls -l...Just know that -l = option and for eg: cat < <file1>, then <file1> = argument.

# ls > <file1> to copy whatever output the command gives you to the file <file1>
  # Will create <file1> in your current working directory.
  # if you then afterwards run pwd > <file1> it will override the output from ls > so now <file1> only contains output from
  pwd > <file1>
  # if you don't want it to be overwritten you can use:
  pwd >> <file1>
  now <file1> will contain the output from both ls and pwd.

# File permissions is one of the most important concepts in Linux
  # u = user, main owner of the file
  # g = group, that owner belongs too
  # o = others (from the outside world)

# chmod o+w <file1>
  # changes the permission for the group Others so that they can write the <file>.

# chmod o-w <file1> 
  # takes the write permission away from group Others
  
# chmod 754 <file>
  # 7, 5, 4 represents the individual permissions for (in this order) user, group, other
  # 1 = execute
  # 2 = write
  # 4 = read permission. Others can now read <file>
  # 0 = No permissions
  # 7 = (4+2+1) --> Got all permissions
  # chmod 777 <file> gives all groups all permissions 

# Hashing Algorithm
# shalsum <filename> | grep <hash from website>
  # To run a hashing algo on a file to make sure/confirm that you have downloaded the correct file. 
  # "red is a good thing - that's what you want to see"

# grep means that you can pattern match

# gzip <file> to compress <file> in its current location/directory.
  # Note that this is not a copy function so you will only have 1 version of <file> and that will be the compressed file
  # After using gzip the file will now have the .gz extension

# gunzip <file.gz> to decompress it ("unzip", "extract") the <file.gz> in its current location/directory.

# tar file is equivalent of a zip file in Windows

# tar cvf <name_of_tar_file.tar> <file1> <file2>
  # This will compress <file1> and <file2> into a tar file called <name_of_tar_file.tar>
  # it will also print <file1> and <file2> to the terminal
  # cvf -> c=create mode, v=display the output in the terminal, f=file option)
  
# tar xvf <name_of_tar_file.tar> to decompress/extract the files within the tar file

# apt = advanced package tool

# sudo = super user do

# java -version
  # Will display what version of Java you have installed
  # If Java not installed it will tell you, so good way to see if the program in question is already installed.

# .sh extension means that its a Shell Script
  # meaning that it is a program that you can run from your terminal

# bash <file.sh> to run a Shell Script.

# sudo useradd <mom>
  # to add a new user called mom
  # when you create user <mom> she will automatically be included in a group also called <mom>
  # sudo passwd <mom>     To change the password for user <mom>

# sudo groupadd <nurses>
  # to add a new group called nurses
  # sudo usermod -a -G <nurses> <mom>   To add user <mom> to the group <nurses>
  # whenever you see a capital G (as in -G) = we're just going to add them to a group
  if you see it with a lowercase g (as in -g) = we're changing their primary group (eg group <mom> for user <mom> in this eg)
  if you use -g you would remove user <mom> from the group <mom> and add her to group <nurses> (now her only group)
  if you use -G the user <mom> would still be in group <mom> and she would be added to group <nurses>

# sudo userdel <mom>
  # to delete user <mom>

# cd ../..    To go up into your parent directory twice (not just once like with cd ..)

# See tutorial 13 - Group and More after the 5 min mark for some cool stuff about how it works behind the scenes in the / directory etc.

# Linux always encrpts passwords so that they are never written in clear text
  # sudo cat shadow (watch the tutorial 13 from above)
  
# DigitalOcean for renting a server online (SSH server). Click the link in Tutorial 14 - Setup and Connect to SSH Server
  # GREAT tutorial on how to set up the server there too.

# ssh <root@45.55.248.198>
  # To connect to the computer 45.55.248.198 as the user root
  # can use commands like ls, pwd, cd etc. just the same on the ssh server since in this example it was setup with Ubuntu as well.

# SSH keys: Private vs Public Key (Tutoral 15)

# ssh-keygen -t rsa
  # to generate public/private rsa key pair
  # ssh-copy-id root@45.55248.198     To add one key...Need to watch the Tutorial while doing this.

# nano </etc/ssh/ssdh_config>
  # nano allows you to edit multiple lines at the time
  
# ALL tutorials on servers are great. Need to watch them as you're doing the work.  
  
# put -r Desktop/Books    (This is done will being connected to the server from your terminal)
  # we're going to add the directory Desktop/Books into the server
  # the -r option means we're doing it "recursively" --> meaning that we will also move all the files that are in the directory
  to our server
  
# get <index.html> Desktop/index.html
  # to download the file <index.html> from your server to Desktop directory with name <index.html>
